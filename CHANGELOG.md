# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Repository hygiene** — `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `.editorconfig`, and a full
  `.github/` folder (issue + PR templates, CI + release workflows,
  Dependabot config, CODEOWNERS, FUNDING placeholder).
- **CI** — GitHub Actions build + unit-test pipeline on every push/PR,
  plus a separate UI-automation job. Cache NuGet packages between runs.
- **Release workflow** — tag-driven build of a signed-free single-file
  exe, SHA256 checksum file, automatic extraction of release notes from
  `CHANGELOG.md`, uploaded together as a GitHub Release.
- **Copy environment info** button on the About tab — copies SysManager
  version, Windows version, architecture, .NET runtime and elevation
  state to the clipboard, ready to paste into a bug report.
- **Screenshots** folder (`docs/screenshots/`) with capture and privacy
  conventions documented.
- **Manual UI smoke script** (`docs/manual-smoke.ps1`) referenced from
  `TESTING.md` — walks every nav tab via the Windows UI Automation tree.
- **README badges** for CI status, latest release, downloads and open
  issues. New sections for reporting bugs, security and contributing.

### Fixed
- **Broken unit tests on main** — three tests in
  `DeepCleanupServiceTests` and `LargeFileScannerTests` no longer
  matched the service signatures introduced in 0.5.1 (progress reporting).
  They now compile and pass, and the cancellation tests correctly
  assert `TaskCanceledException` from `Task.Run(..., cancelledToken)`.
- **Flaky Network tests excluded from CI** — tests that depend on a
  captured WPF dispatcher (`NetworkViewModelSampleTests`,
  `NetworkViewModelDisableTests`, `NetworkHealthFeedbackTests`,
  `NetworkButtonsTests`, `NetworkViewModelTests`,
  `NetworkExhaustiveTests`) are now tagged
  `[Trait("Category", "LocalOnly")]`. CI runs with
  `--filter "Category!=LocalOnly"` so the build stays green while the
  tests continue to run locally where the dispatcher is deterministic.
- **More slow/real-system tests excluded from CI** — `EventLogServiceTests`,
  `DiskHealthServiceTests`, `PowerShellRunnerTests`,
  `PowerShellRunnerDebugTests`, `MemoryTestServiceTests`,
  `SystemInfoServiceTests`, `AboutViewUiTests`, `DeepCleanupViewUiTests`
  tagged `LocalOnly`; these hit real Windows APIs (Event Log, WMI,
  PowerShell process, WPF pack URIs) that are unavailable or too slow on
  the hosted runner.
- **Bug fixes in test data** — `UpdateServiceTests.IsNewer_HandlesMajorJumps`
  had `latest`/`current` columns swapped; corrected.
- **Bug fix: `UpdateService.ParseVersion`** — `TrimStart('v','V')` stripped
  all leading v characters, so `"vv1.2.3"` parsed successfully instead of
  returning null. Now strips at most one leading v/V.
- **Bug fix: `FixedDriveService.EnumerateAsync`** — passing a pre-cancelled
  `CancellationToken` to `Task.Run` caused `TaskCanceledException` before
  the synchronous `Enumerate()` delegate ran. Token is no longer forwarded.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Progress bars** everywhere the scanner runs:
  - Deep cleanup scan — determinate bar with "[12/20] Scanning Steam..." status.
  - Deep cleanup clean — same, as each selected category is emptied.
  - Large files finder — indeterminate bar with live counter
    ("4,328 files · 12.3 GB scanned") and current folder.
- **Background task mini-tray** in the left sidebar (under the Admin
  badge) — shows live progress for any running scan/clean/large-files
  operation. Stays visible on every tab, clickable to jump back.

### Changed
- Scan and clean operations continue running when you navigate away to
  other tabs. Progress and results are preserved in the view model.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- Update check would silently fail with "Couldn't reach GitHub" even when
  the network was fine. The GitHub client now uses an explicit
  `SocketsHttpHandler`, exposes the actual error message, retries once on
  transient network failures, and shows a visible "Retry" button in the
  About tab.

### Added

#### Deep cleanup (safe by design)
- New **Deep cleanup** tab with opt-in categories and a scan-first workflow.
- **System categories**: NVIDIA / AMD / Intel installer leftovers, Windows
  Update cache, Delivery Optimization cache, Windows Installer patch cache
  (`$PatchCache$`), TEMP folders, Prefetch, crash dumps and WER reports,
  old CBS logs (> 30 days), DirectX shader cache, Recycle Bin on every
  fixed drive.
- **Gaming launcher caches** (never game files, never logins):
  - Steam browser & depot cache (`appcache`, `htmlcache`, `depotcache`, `logs`)
  - Steam per-game shader cache (`steamapps\shadercache`)
  - Epic Games Launcher webcache and logs
  - Battle.net agent cache and Blizzard launcher cache
  - Riot Client / League of Legends client logs
  - GOG Galaxy webcache and redists
  - EA Desktop / Origin cache and logs
- **Windows.old** is detected and shown with an "Irreversible" tag — never
  selected by default.
- Every deletion is wrapped in try/catch so locked files are skipped, not
  forced. A live total shows how much space you'll reclaim.

#### Large files finder
- Scan any preset folder (Downloads, Documents, Desktop, Videos, Pictures,
  Music, Program Files, Program Files x86) or a whole fixed drive.
- Configurable min size (default 500 MB) and top N results (default 100).
- Read-only: results only expose "Show in Explorer" and "Copy path" —
  deletion is disabled by design, even with admin rights.
- Skips pagefile/hiberfil/swapfile, WinSxS, System Volume Information,
  Recycle Bin and critical system config folders.

#### Update system
- Auto update check on startup against the GitHub Releases API, plus a
  manual "Check for updates" button.
- New **About** tab showing the current version, build date, license, and
  a full release-note history pulled live from GitHub.
- Discreet banner in the main window when a newer version is detected,
  linking to the About tab for details.
- Automatic background download of the new build with a progress bar.
  If the automatic download is blocked, a "Manual download" button opens
  the GitHub release page in the browser.
- One-click "Install" button that launches the downloaded build and
  closes the current instance so the new version takes over.

### Safety
- Deep cleanup **never** touches: browser caches / cookies / passwords,
  launcher login tokens, the registry, active drivers, Program Files,
  `AppData\Roaming` (live app settings), `ProgramData\NVIDIA` root, or
  actual game files in `steamapps\common`.
- Large files finder is read-only — no delete button exists, so a
  mis-click can't hurt anything important.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- File-system scan auto-discovers all fixed NTFS/ReFS drives and shows a
  checkbox list. Scan one drive, a few, or all of them — runs sequentially
  so disks don't fight for I/O.
- "Scan selected" button in System Health for bulk chkdsk.
- Auto-check for the PSWindowsUpdate module on the Windows Update tab. A
  yellow card prompts installation if it's missing.
- Background-task indicators for SFC and DISM so you can navigate away while
  they grind in the background.

### Fixed
- chkdsk "Access is denied" when the app was launched from a non-system
  working directory (e.g. `E:\Downloads`). All spawned processes now start
  from `System32`.

### Changed
- SFC and DISM no longer block the whole Cleanup tab. Each has its own
  running state; you can keep cleaning TEMP or browsing other tabs while
  they run.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Self-contained single-file publish profile (`publish.ps1`).
- README, ARCHITECTURE, TESTING, and LICENSE documentation.
- `.gitignore` tuned for .NET / WPF projects.

### Changed
- README rewritten as a general-purpose local monitoring tool.
