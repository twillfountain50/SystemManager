## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- File-system scan now auto-discovers all fixed NTFS/ReFS drives and shows a
  checkbox list. Scan one drive, a few, or all of them — runs sequentially
  so disks don't fight for I/O.
- "Scan selected" button in System Health for bulk chkdsk.
- Auto-check for the PSWindowsUpdate module on the Windows Update tab. A
  yellow card prompts installation if it's missing.
- Background-task indicators for SFC and DISM so you can navigate away while
  they grind in the background.

### Fixed
- chkdsk "Access is denied" when the app was launched from a non-system
  working directory (e.g. `E:\Downloads`). All spawned processes now start
  from `System32`.

### Changed
- SFC and DISM no longer block the whole Cleanup tab. Each has its own
  running state; you can keep cleaning TEMP or browsing other tabs while
  they run.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Self-contained single-file publish profile (`publish.ps1`).
- README, ARCHITECTURE, TESTING, and LICENSE documentation.
- `.gitignore` tuned for .NET / WPF projects.

### Changed
- README rewritten as a general-purpose local monitoring tool.
